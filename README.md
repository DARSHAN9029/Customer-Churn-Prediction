# 💼 Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict whether a customer will churn, based on various features like age, balance, tenure, etc. The model is built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, and the app is deployed using **Streamlit** for interactive predictions.
